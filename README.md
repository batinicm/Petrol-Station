# Petrol-Station
Simulation of a working petrol station using GUI.  

Petrol station consists of 4 pumps. Pumps are realized as threads. As the petrol station opens, cars queue up for filling. 

The GUI consists of a list on the left side, showing the cars in the queue, and four horizontal lines showing the state of the tanks of cars currently being filled at individual pumps.
